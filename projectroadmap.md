# Our Findings include:
From: https://github.com/dhrumilp12/Health-Sync

Kerrian: Some specific things I learned in evaluating the code URL above is that the repository currently lacks detailed documentation and clear instructions for setting up and running the application. I also learned that when evaluating certain code, make sure that their is structure, organization, and readability. Unfortunately, this code did not run and it was kind of long. I was able to clone it to my computer and access it in Visual Studio Code, but I would say it lacks in user-friendliness. There are some comments made within the code, but they are not specific enough to understand what is exactly happening with the code. My group and I are still deciding whether we want to use the code or improve it. However, we might use certain aspects of the code such as medication reminders because it contains code that asks for things like specific medication names, dosage, and frequency.
