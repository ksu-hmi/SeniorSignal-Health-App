## Background: 
Elderly people who do not have a stable support system face many challenges on a daily basis, especially when it comes to keeping track of managing their daily health tasks and routines. While challenges differ among elderly individuals, some of the common challenges they face are issues with medication management, health monitoring, making sure they drink plenty of water, and getting exercise. These challenges can also be concerning for individuals who suffer from cognitive decline. 

## Who Would Use It? 
-Elderly individuals who may struggle with managing their health  

-Seniors with memory issues, who need assistance keeping track of their medications 

-Caregivers who wish to monitor the well-being of their loved ones. 

## What Would It Do? 

### Medication Reminders 

Senior Signal will provide customizable reminders to help seniors take their medications at the right time and in the correct dosage. The reminders can be customized based on specific medications and their time schedule. It will notify users when it’s time to take their medication.  

### Hydration Reminders 

The app will send notifications at regular intervals throughout the day, reminding the user to drink water. Users will be able to track their water consumption which will allow them to make sure they are staying hydrated. 

### Exercise Reminders 

Senior Signal can offer simple, low-impact exercise suggestions based on the user’s mobility level. Whether it’s taking a short walk, stretching, or doing chair exercises, the app will send periodic reminders and provide step-by-step instructions for exercises.
