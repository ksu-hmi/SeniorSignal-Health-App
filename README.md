## Background: 
Elderly people who do not have a stable support system face many challenges on a daily basis, especially when it comes to keeping track of managing their daily health tasks and routines. While challenges differ among elderly individuals, some of the common challenges they face are issues with medication management, health monitoring, making sure they drink plenty of water, and getting exercise. These challenges can also be concerning for individuals who suffer from cognitive decline. 

## Who Would Use It? 
-Elderly individuals who may struggle with managing their health  

-Seniors with memory issues, who need assistance keeping track of their medications 

-Caregivers who wish to monitor the well-being of their loved ones.
